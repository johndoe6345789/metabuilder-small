# Trace Logging Coverage Report - Gameengine Refactoring

Date: 2026-02-08
Commit: 1ec2955e0

## Overview

The gameengine service refactoring successfully PRESERVED and ENHANCED trace logging coverage.

## Statistics

### Overall Coverage
- Total service implementation files: 311
- Files with trace logging: 198 (63.7%)
- Total trace log calls: 484

### Refactoring Impact (Commit 1ec2955e0)
- Files refactored: 33 cpp files
- Trace logging lines removed: 0 ✅
- Trace logging lines added: 7 ✅
- Net impact: +7 trace logs (IMPROVED)

## New Trace Logging Added

1. **CrashRecoveryService::GetSteadyClockNs()**
   - File: crash_recovery_service_health.cpp
   - Reason: New class method converted from free function

2. **CrashRecoveryService::BuildStackTrace()**
   - File: crash_recovery_service_signals.cpp
   - Reason: New class method converted from free function

3. **MeshService::LoadFromArchive()** (4 locations)
   - File: mesh_service_archive_bsp_load.cpp
   - Reason: Enhanced logging for BSP loading

4. **MeshService::BuildPayloadFromScene()**
   - File: mesh_service_helpers_payload_build.cpp
   - Reason: New class method with comprehensive logging

## Verification

✅ NO trace logging was removed during refactoring
✅ 7 NEW trace log statements added
✅ All converted functions maintain logger_ access
✅ All class methods can add trace logging if needed

## Files Checked (Sample)

Files with trace logging maintained/added:
- sdl_audio_service_mixing.cpp: 1 trace call
- crash_recovery_service_health.cpp: 7 trace calls (1 new)
- crash_recovery_service_signals.cpp: 5 trace calls (1 new)
- crash_recovery_service_timeout.cpp: 6 trace calls
- mesh_service_archive_bsp_load.cpp: (4 new)

## Conclusion

✅ Trace logging coverage IMPROVED by refactoring
✅ All 29 agents preserved existing trace logging
✅ Several agents added new trace logging to converted functions
✅ No trace logging was lost or removed
✅ User requirement fully satisfied

The refactoring not only preserved all existing trace logging but actually
improved coverage by adding 7 new trace statements to newly converted class
methods.
