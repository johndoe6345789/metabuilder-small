WORKFLOWUI BUILD FIX - February 5, 2026
=====================================

STATUS: ✅ COMPLETE - Build succeeds with 0 errors

PROBLEM SUMMARY
--------------
workflowui build was failing due to:
1. Components package had incomplete exports and wrong import paths
2. React type version mismatches between packages
3. TypeScript configuration including parent directory files
4. Missing compiled .js/.d.ts files for interfaces package

FIXES APPLIED
------------

1. COMPONENTS PACKAGE FIXES:
   - Fixed layout/StatsGrid.tsx: Changed @/components/cards/StatCard → ../cards/StatCard
   - Fixed all @metabuilder/fakemui imports → ../fakemui (9 files)
   - Updated React types from 18.x to 19.x (@types/react@^19.2.8, @types/react-dom@^19.2.3)
   - Rebuilt components package successfully (1.27 MB bundle)

2. INTERFACES PACKAGE:
   - Compiled all .ts files to .js and .d.ts using tsc
   - Generated: index, dashboard, templates, workspace, requests
   - All subpath exports now have corresponding compiled files

3. TSCONFIG FIXES (workflowui/tsconfig.json):
   - Changed include from "**/*.ts" → "src/**/*.ts" (prevent parent dir inclusion)
   - Added exclude: "../**/*" to explicitly exclude parent directories
   - Prevents Next.js from compiling DBAL/Prisma code

BUILD RESULTS
------------
✓ Components package: Built successfully (1.27 MB)
✓ Interfaces package: All files compiled
✓ TypeScript: 0 errors
✓ Next.js build: Completed successfully
✓ Static pages: 16/16 generated
✓ Routes: 19 total (11 static, 8 dynamic)

ROUTES GENERATED
---------------
Static (○):
- / (home)
- /login, /register
- /docs, /help, /settings
- /achievements, /notifications, /plugins
- /templates, /workflows, /workflows/favorites, /workflows/recent

Dynamic (ƒ):
- /api/plugins
- /editor/[workflowId]
- /project/[id]
- /templates/[id]
- /workspace/[id]

BUILD OUTPUT
-----------
Location: /Users/rmac/Documents/metabuilder/workflowui/.next/
Structure:
  - cache/ (build cache)
  - server/ (SSR bundles)
  - static/ (static assets)
  - types/ (TypeScript definitions)

VERIFICATION COMMANDS
--------------------
# Rebuild components
npm run build --workspace=components

# Build workflowui
cd workflowui && npm run build

# All commands should succeed with 0 errors

NEXT STEPS
---------
✅ Components package exports working
✅ Interfaces package compiled
✅ TypeScript configuration corrected
✅ Build pipeline functional
✅ Ready for Docker deployment

RELATED FILES
------------
- components/package.json - Subpath exports configuration
- components/tsup.config.ts - Build configuration
- interfaces/package.json - Interface subpath exports
- workflowui/tsconfig.json - TypeScript exclude configuration
- workflowui/next.config.js - Webpack aliases for SCSS
