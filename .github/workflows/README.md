# GitHub Workflows Documentation

This directory contains automated workflows for CI/CD, code quality, and comprehensive AI-assisted development throughout the entire SDLC.

## 🚦 Enterprise Gated Tree Workflow

MetaBuilder uses a **Unified Enterprise Gated Pipeline** that consolidates all CI/CD, deployment, and development assistance into a single workflow with clear gate visualization.

**📖 Complete Guide:** [Enterprise Gated Workflow Documentation](../../docs/ENTERPRISE_GATED_WORKFLOW.md)

### Quick Overview

All PRs and deployments flow through 6 sequential gates in a single workflow:

1. **Gate 1: Code Quality** - Prisma, TypeScript, Lint, Security (7 atomic steps)
2. **Gate 2: Testing** - Unit, E2E, DBAL Daemon tests (3 atomic steps)
3. **Gate 3: Build & Package** - Application build, quality metrics (2 atomic steps)
4. **Gate 4: Development Assistance** - Architectural feedback, Copilot interaction (PR only)
5. **Gate 5: Staging Deployment** - Automatic deployment to staging (main branch push)
6. **Gate 6: Production Deployment** - Manual approval required (release/workflow_dispatch)

**Key Benefits:**
- ✅ **Single unified workflow** - No confusion about which pipeline runs what
- ✅ Sequential gates prevent wasted resources
- ✅ Tree structure for clear visualization of all validation steps
- ✅ Automatic merge after approval
- ✅ Conditional execution based on trigger (PR vs push vs release)
- ✅ Complete audit trail for all deployments

### Pipeline Consolidation (Jan 2026)

**Consolidated into `gated-pipeline.yml`:**
- ✅ `gated-ci.yml` (1048 lines) - CI with gates 1-5
- ✅ `gated-deployment.yml` (617 lines) - Deployment workflows
- ✅ `development.yml` (360 lines) - Development assistance

**Result:** Single 1287-line workflow with all functionality preserved and no duplication.

**Previous Deprecated and Removed (Dec 2025):**
- ❌ `ci/ci.yml` - Replaced by gated workflows
- ❌ `quality/deployment.yml` - Replaced by gated workflows

See [Legacy Pipeline Cruft Report](../../docs/LEGACY_PIPELINE_CRUFT_REPORT.md) for analysis.

## 🤖 GitHub Copilot Integration

All workflows are designed to work seamlessly with **GitHub Copilot** to assist throughout the Software Development Lifecycle:

- **Planning Phase**: Architecture review, PRD alignment, implementation guidance
- **Development Phase**: Continuous quality feedback, code suggestions, refactoring opportunities
- **Testing Phase**: Automated code review, security checks, quality validation
- **Deployment Phase**: Pre-deployment validation, health checks, monitoring
- **Maintenance Phase**: Issue triage, automated fixes, dependency management

**📖 Copilot Instructions:** [.github/copilot-instructions.md](../copilot-instructions.md)

## Workflows Overview

### 🚦 Enterprise Gated Workflow (Unified)

#### Enterprise Gated Pipeline (`gated-pipeline.yml`) 🆕
**Triggered on:** Push to main/master/develop, Pull requests, Releases, Manual dispatch, Issue comments

**Consolidates:** All CI/CD, deployment, and development assistance in one workflow

- Summary report with all gate results

### 🔍 CodeQL Code Search (Manual)

#### CodeQL Analysis (`codeql-analysis.yml`)
**Triggered on:** Manual dispatch only (workflow_dispatch)

**Purpose:** Semantic code search and story planning across 2-3M LOC codebase

**NOT for security gates** - This is separate from gated-pipeline.yml. Use it for:
- Pattern search across the entire codebase
- Finding function callers and data flows
- Planning user stories by understanding code relationships
- Complex QL queries for refactoring planning

**Languages Indexed:**
| Language | Locations | Priority |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| TypeScript/JavaScript | `frontends/`, `packages/`, `fakemui/react/` | HIGH |
| Python | `workflow/plugins/python/`, `services/`, `smtprelay/` | MEDIUM |
| C++ | `dbal/production/`, `frontends/cli/`, `frontends/qt6/`, `gameengine/` | MEDIUM |
| Go | `workflow/plugins/go/` | LOW |

**Usage:**
1. Go to Actions tab → "CodeQL Analysis" → "Run workflow"
2. Select languages to analyze (or "all")
3. Wait for analysis to complete (can take 30-60 min for full codebase)
4. Use GitHub Advanced Search or Security tab to query results

**Example Use Cases:**
- "Find all components using Redux state" → plan migration stories
- "Find all API endpoints" → plan documentation stories
- "Find deprecated function usage" → plan refactoring stories
- "Trace data flow from input to database" → plan security reviews

**Configuration:** `.github/codeql/codeql-config.yml`

## 🔄 Supporting Workflows

#### Issue and PR Triage (`triage.yml`)
**Triggered on:** Issues (opened/edited/reopened) and Pull Requests (opened/reopened/synchronize/edited)

**Purpose:** Quickly categorize inbound work so reviewers know what to look at first.

- Auto-applies labels for type (bug/enhancement/docs/security/testing/performance) and area (frontend/backend/database/workflows/documentation)
- Sets a default priority and highlights beginner-friendly issues
- Flags missing information (repro steps, expected/actual results, versions) with a checklist comment
- For PRs, labels areas touched, estimates risk based on change size and critical paths, and prompts for test plans/screenshots/linked issues
- Mentions **@copilot** to sanity-check the triage with GitHub-native AI

This workflow runs alongside the gated pipeline to provide quick triage feedback.

### 🗑️ Legacy Workflows (Removed)

#### CI/CD Workflow (`ci/ci.yml`) - ❌ REMOVED
**Status:** Deprecated and removed (Dec 2025)

## Contributing

When adding new workflows:
1. Document the workflow in this README
2. Add appropriate error handling
3. Test the workflow on a test branch
4. Ensure proper permissions are set
5. Add labels if needed (they'll be created automatically)

## Security

Workflows use `GITHUB_TOKEN` with minimal required permissions:
- `contents: read/write` - For reading code and merging PRs
- `pull-requests: write` - For commenting and managing PRs
- `issues: write` - For managing issues
- `checks: read` - For reading CI status

No secrets are required for basic functionality.
