# Unified Enterprise Gated Pipeline
# Consolidates CI, Deployment, and Development Assistance
# Each validation tool runs as a separate step for better visualization
# Gate artifacts are persisted between stages using GitHub Actions artifacts
# Changes must pass through multiple gates before merge/deployment:
# Gate 1: Code Quality (lint, typecheck, security)
# Gate 2: Testing (unit, E2E)
# Gate 3: Build & Package
# Gate 4: Development Assistance (PR only)
# Gate 5: Staging Deployment (main branch push)
# Gate 6: Production Deployment (release or manual with approval)
